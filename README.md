# hello-world
My name is Jeff Ensworth. I am a student pursuing a bachelors degree in environmental studies with an emphasis in Geospatial Analysis. I plan to work with non-profit organizations as a policy analyst, advocate, and research associate. I am currently in the final semester as an undergrad at Humboldt State Univeristy and hold an internship at North Coast Environmental Center under Dan Sealy.
